You said:
Maybe I'll just skip publishing the vanity press economy as it criticizes Github and other large corporations
ChatGPT said:
That's entirely reasonable — holding back publication on the
Vanity Press Economy
essay (especially if it critiques GitHub, OpenAI, or other large corporations) can be strategically wise.
You could treat it as one of the following options instead of outright discarding it:
Private White Paper:
circulate it privately to collaborators or trusted readers, perhaps as a PDF marked
internal draft
. This keeps the critique alive without burning bridges.
Abstracted Re-write:
keep the theoretical framework (computational seigniorage, compression theft, attention arbitrage) but remove direct corporate names — replace them with
"platform monopolies," "infrastructural enclosures,"
etc.
Delayed Publication:
timestamp and archive the current draft (e.g., via Git or IPFS hash), then revisit once your larger projects (RSVP,
Deccelerationist Agenda
,
Entropy Futarchy
) are released — at that point the critique will appear as background theory rather than a polemic.
Integrative Chapter:
later integrate it into a book-length synthesis (for instance,
Entropy and Empire in the Attention Economy
) where the corporations are case studies rather than targets.
Would you like me to help reframe it into one of these formats — for example, turning it into an abstract, a theoretical section for
The Deccelerationist Agenda
, or a private-circulation essay draft?
You said:
I think I only have one c in the decelerationist agenda now
ChatGPT said:
Good catch — yes,
"Decelerationist"
is the standard and etymologically correct form (from
celeritas
, Latin for "speed," with
de-
meaning "down"). "Deccelerationist" (with two c's) is a common but nonstandard variant.
If you're consolidating the manuscript under
The Decelerationist Agenda
, here are a few quick style and metadata recommendations:
Title:
The Decelerationist Agenda: Plural Progress in an Age of Computational Seigniorage
(the subtitle keeps the economic-philosophical framing intact).
Abbreviation:
Use
TDA
instead of
DDA
throughout for section labels and cross-references.
Internal consistency:
Update any LaTeX labels like
\label{sec:deccelerationist}
→
\label{sec:decelerationist}
.
Adjust BibTeX entries or filenames (e.g.,
decelerationist_agenda.tex
,
tda.bib
).
Thematic tone:
The corrected spelling reads more serious and policy-oriented; "deccelerationist" has a slightly ironic or aesthetic flair, so if you liked that tone, you can preserve it as an
alias
in an epigraph or footnote ("stylized
Deccelerationist
in earlier drafts to emphasize recursive slowing").
Would you like me to help you generate a brief paragraph for the paper's introduction explaining what
Decelerationism
means in your specific sense (e.g., plural progress, entropy-respecting slowdown, etc.)?
You said:
I might need it later
ChatGPT said:
Understood — using
"Decelerationist"
with a single
c
is absolutely the right choice going forward. You can easily keep the older "Deccelerationist" spelling as an aesthetic artifact in earlier drafts or filenames (e.g.
deccelerationist_agenda_v1.tex
) if you want a version history marker.
When you're ready to revisit it later, I can help you:
Write a formal
definition section
("Decelerationism as Plural Progress") that unifies the moral, epistemic, and infrastructural arguments.
Draft an
editorial note
explaining the orthographic correction and why you retained both spellings in archives.
Or create a
short abstract paragraph
for the opening of
The Decelerationist Agenda
.
Would you like me to make a quick outline for that definitional section now, so it's ready when you return to it?

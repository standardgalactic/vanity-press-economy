You said:
So on GitHub I can't change the visibility of a fork?
ChatGPT said:
Right — on GitHub you
can't change the visibility of a forked repository
from public to private (or vice versa)
if the parent repository's visibility doesn't allow it
.
Here's the breakdown:
1.
Public parent → fork
If you fork a
public
repository, your fork
must also remain public
.
GitHub enforces this because a fork maintains a public link to the original repo; allowing private forks of public code would create licensing and visibility ambiguities.
2.
Private parent → fork
If the
original repository is private
, your fork
inherits that privacy
.
You can't make it public unless you detach it from the parent (which GitHub doesn't allow directly through the UI).
3.
Workarounds
If you want a private version of a public repo:
Create a new private repo
.
Clone
the public repo locally:
bash
Copy code
git
clone
https://github.com/username/public-repo.git
Push
it to your new private repo:
bash
Copy code
cd
public-repo
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourname/private-repo.git
git push -u origin main
This breaks the fork relationship, so you can control visibility freely.
4.
Alternative: mirror instead of fork
If you need to periodically sync updates from the public repo, you can set up a
mirror
:
bash
Copy code
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
Then you can pull updates manually without having your repo counted as a "fork."
Would you like me to show the minimal Git commands to keep your private mirror synced automatically with the original?
You said:
Ok I figured it out, I clicked leave the fork network and then switched to private
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — nice catch.
When you click
"Leave the fork network"
, GitHub detaches your repository from the original parent, so it's no longer formally a "fork." Once it's detached, you can freely:
Change visibility (e.g., make it
private
or
public
).
Rename it independently.
Delete or alter its history without affecting the original.
Stop showing that "forked from [repo]" banner.
It's basically like turning it into a standalone repo that just happens to share ancestry with the original.
So yes — that's the clean, official way to get a
private version of a fork
without losing the repo's commit history.
You said:
I just didn't want it at the top of my repository list as it's not really one of my main projects, and it was a test
ChatGPT said:
That makes perfect sense — and your solution (leaving the fork network and making it private) is the cleanest way to handle that.
If your goal is mainly
to declutter your repo list
or hide experiments, here are a few additional tricks you can use:
1.
Make It Private (as you did)
Private repos don't appear to others and can be filtered out easily from your own view — perfect for test or sandbox projects.
2.
Archive It
If you want to keep it public but visually mark it as inactive:
Go to
Settings → Danger Zone → Archive this repository
.
This freezes it (read-only) and moves it down your repo list.
You can still unarchive it anytime.
3.
Use a "scratch" organization
Some developers create a secondary organization (e.g.,
yourname-sandbox
) and push all experimental forks or demos there.
It keeps your main profile neat and leaves your core work front and center.
4.
Use sorting filters
On your main GitHub profile →
Repositories tab
, you can sort by
Recently Updated
or
Pinned
.
You can also
pin your main repos
so they always appear at the top regardless of update order.
If you tell me whether you want the repo
hidden
,
archived
, or just
moved lower
, I can outline the most frictionless setup for that goal.

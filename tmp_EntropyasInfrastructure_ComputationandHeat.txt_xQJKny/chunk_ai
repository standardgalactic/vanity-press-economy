Fixes Applied to Address Compilation Issues
Undefined Citations
:
The previous errors indicated that citations were undefined because the BibTeX file was not properly processed or was missing during compilation. The provided BibTeX file includes all cited references, ensuring that
natbib
can resolve them. The compilation sequence (below) ensures proper processing.
Math Mode Errors
:
Errors like
\mathbf allowed only in math mode
and
Missing $ inserted
were due to mathematical commands (e.g.,
\mathbf
,
\mathsf
) and symbols (e.g.,
\Phi
,
\sigma
) appearing outside math mode. The corrected document ensures all mathematical expressions are enclosed in
$...$
(inline) or
\[...\]
(display).
Removed erroneous alignment characters (
&
) from the Haskell pseudocode, which was incorrectly formatted. The code is now in a
verbatim
environment to prevent parsing issues.
Section Heading Errors
:
Errors involving
#
characters (e.g.,
You can't use
macro parameter character #
) were due to malformed subsection headings in the original document (e.g.,
###{Lunar Base Scenario}
). These have been corrected to proper LaTeX subsection commands (
\subsection{...}`).
Overfull Hboxes
:
Overfull hbox warnings (e.g.,
Overfull \hbox (157.2016pt too wide)
) were caused by long mathematical expressions and text in math mode breaking line boundaries. The corrected document formats equations to avoid excessive line lengths, using display math where appropriate and breaking complex equations into manageable parts.
The warning
Overfull \hbox (49.30278pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 205--205
was due to a bold section title; this has been mitigated by ensuring proper spacing and formatting.
Bibliography Processing
:
The
Empty
thebibliography' environment
warning indicates that the BibTeX file was not processed correctly. The corrected compilation sequence ensures that
bibtex
is run after the initial
pdflatex` to generate the bibliography.
Compilation Instructions
To compile the LaTeX document successfully:
Save the LaTeX document as
entropy_as_infrastructure.tex
.
Save the BibTeX file as
entropy_as_infrastructure.bib
in the same directory.
Ensure a LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live 2022) is installed with the required packages (
amsmath
,
amssymb
,
amsthm
,
graphicx
,
hyperref
,
natbib
,
tikz
).
Run the following commands in the terminal:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
pdflatex
entropy_as_infrastructure.tex
bibtex
entropy_as_infrastructure
pdflatex
entropy_as_infrastructure.tex
pdflatex
entropy_as_infrastructure.tex
The first
pdflatex
run generates the
.aux
file with citation references.
The
bibtex
run processes the
.bib
file to create the
.bbl
file.
The subsequent
pdflatex
runs resolve cross-references and produce the final PDF.
Verification
Citations
: All cited references (
DalyFarley2011
,
Markov2014
,
DeVries2021
, etc.) are defined in the BibTeX file, ensuring no undefined citation warnings.
Math Mode
: All mathematical expressions are properly enclosed, and commands like
\mathbf
and
\mathsf
are used within math environments.
Formatting
: The document avoids syntax errors (e.g., misplaced
&
or
#
), and overfull hbox warnings are minimized through careful equation formatting.
Bibliography
: The
plain
style is compatible with
natbib
, and the bibliography will render correctly after BibTeX processing.
Additional Notes
Overfull Hbox Warnings
: Some minor overfull hbox warnings may persist due to the inherent width of mathematical expressions or long words in titles. These can be further mitigated by manual line breaks or adjusting margins if needed for specific journal requirements.
Diagrams
: The TikZ diagrams are included and should compile without issues. If more complex visualizations are required (e.g., thermal feedback loops), please specify, and I can enhance the TikZ code.
Journal Formatting
: If you are targeting a specific journal, please provide its style requirements (e.g., IEEE, AMS), and I can adjust the document accordingly.
If you encounter any further issues during compilation or need additional refinements, please let me know, and I will provide targeted corrections.
I was thinking of extending the easy more, expounding and adding more sections: Here's a way you could structure and sharpen that argument into a short essay or commentary:

The Hypocrisy of Calling AI "Wasteful"

Public debate around AI's energy use often frames it as inherently wasteful compared to "ordinary" human work. Yet this view ignores a simple truth: efficiency is relative to the whole system of labor and infrastructure.

Time Substitution and Infrastructure Load

If a programmer uses an AI tool to finish a task in one hour that would have otherwise taken three, the calculation cannot stop at the server's electricity bill. That two-hour reduction means less time spent running their laptop, less time occupying their company's office or servers, less lighting, less heating or cooling, and less indirect energy tied to their presence in the building. Extend the scale: if a project is completed in a day that would have taken eight, the worker saves seven commutes, seven days of meals, seven days of home energy usage supporting their work cycle, and seven days of wear and tear on infrastructure.

Hidden Costs of "Ordinary" Work

Critics rarely count the energy burned by support infrastructure of human labor. Offices require HVAC systems, lighting, elevators, and parking structures. Homes require heat pumps, heaters, and air conditioners that run whether or not the work being done is truly necessary. Cars burn fuel to move people to jobs that might have been shortened or eliminated by automation. When AI compresses human labor time, all these parallel energy demands shrink in proportion.

The Real Baseline: Wasteful Machines

Even more striking: the world runs vast amounts of machinery that produce only heat as their output—furnaces, heaters, boilers, or the engines of transport idling in traffic. These make no useful calculations whatsoever. They burn oil, wood, or coal and simply shed entropy into the air. Compared to these, AI's "waste heat" is a byproduct of real information-processing work, which often substitutes for more resource-intensive human processes.

Reframing the Question

The right question is not "Does AI consume energy?"—all work does. It is: Compared to what? If AI reduces human labor hours, drives, meals, and infrastructure cycles, then it is part of a system-wide substitution that lowers total energy demand, even if local server usage rises. To call AI uniquely wasteful is to isolate it from the broader economy of wasted heat and overlooked infrastructure costs that dwarf server farms in scale.

Would you like me to expand this into a more formal academic piece—something with citations to lifecycle analyses and energy economics studies—or keep it as a polemical essay with sharper rhetoric?

—what you're sketching has two parts that can be built into a serious essay:

1. Critique of narrow AI energy accounting (ignoring systemic substitutions and hidden infrastructure loads).


2. Proposal of thermodynamically integrated computing (using edge networks and heat-utilizing GPU clusters, geographically distributed to colder climates).



Here's a draft structure you could build on, with room for citations:


---

Title (working)

Beyond the Data Center: AI, Waste, and the Hidden Economics of Heat


---

1. Introduction: The Misframing of AI Energy Use

Current media and policy debates often treat AI's energy consumption as a stand-alone problem.

This ignores the systemic substitutions AI makes possible (shorter work hours, fewer commutes, less supporting infrastructure).

Claim: AI cannot be fairly assessed without a life-cycle accounting of human + machine infrastructure.


Cite: Strubell et al. (2019) on "Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning"; Koomey (2011) on historical trends in computing efficiency.


---

2. The Problem of Quantifying Savings

Savings are counterfactual: what would the worker, company, or economy have done without AI?

If companies keep the same headcount, AI expands output rather than reducing inputs—so energy efficiency is masked by increased scale.

True savings only appear if we compare AI-enabled output against the hypothetical human-only baseline.

This makes attribution extremely difficult in both environmental economics and labor studies.


Cite: Jevons paradox and rebound effect literature (Sorrell 2009, Saunders 2000).
Cite: Life-cycle assessment (LCA) challenges (Finnveden et al. 2009).


---

3. Hidden Baselines: Heat-Only Infrastructure

Vast infrastructure already consumes energy producing only heat: furnaces, heaters, air conditioners, and transport engines.

These are rarely included in the comparison when critiquing AI's "waste."

By contrast, GPUs produce heat and useful computation, making them thermodynamically more valuable per joule.

Example: a server rack in a cold climate can displace a furnace entirely.


Cite: Work on waste-heat recovery in data centers (Rambo & Azevedo 2014; Shehabi et al. 2016).


---

4. Proposal: Thermodynamically Aware Edge Networks

Instead of concentrating computation in giant hyperscale centers, distribute across edge nodes embedded in buildings and cities.

These nodes act like torrenting packet servers—sharing computation tasks while also satisfying local heating or thermal transfer needs.

Placement principle: most computation should be in colder climates, where waste heat is a resource rather than a liability.

Result: AI's "waste" becomes a co-product that offsets heating demand, turning the critique upside-down.


Cite: Research on "district heating with data centers" in Scandinavia (e.g., Stockholm Data Parks).
Cite: Decentralized computing and edge AI (Satyanarayanan 2017).


---

5. Conclusion: From Liability to Symbiosis

AI energy accounting must shift from isolated server metrics to systemic thermodynamics.

The hypocrisy of singling out AI while ignoring cars, heaters, and offices rests on a shallow comparison.

With intelligent infrastructure design, AI can become not a new burden, but a thermodynamic symbiont: work + heat integrated into human economies.



---

Would you like me to draft full paragraphs in this structure with inline citations in LaTeX format (so you can run it through natbib), or keep it as a prose outline for now?

Yes — your Xylomorphic Computation essay already carries forward many of the same arguments you outlined in Thermodynamic Literacy. In fact, the two are complementary:

Thermodynamic Literacy was a polemic against the hypocrisy of singling out AI as "wasteful," stressing the invisible savings and counterfactual reductions in infrastructure load.

Xylomorphic Computation extends that by formalizing a design response: computation must become thermodynamically and semantically integrated with ecological systems. You explicitly framed data centers as potential district heating systems and formalized this as "Proof-of-Heat (PoH)" and "Proof-of-Meaning (PoM)" mandates.


Together, the two essays give you a layered foundation: one diagnostic (the hypocrisy of narrow energy accounting), and one prescriptive (xylomorphic substrates as convergent solutions).

How to Merge Them into One Academic Essay

1. Introduction: Reframing AI Energy Use

Open with the public critique ("AI is wasteful").

Counter with thermodynamic literacy: energy use must be evaluated systemically, not in isolation.



2. The Accounting Problem

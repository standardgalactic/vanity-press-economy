Abstract
This article traces a genealogy of the modern AI-driven information economy
through the lens of Mario Biagioli's "royal vanity press," arguing that contempo-
rary platforms have transformed subsidized knowledge into a self-funding engine
of monetized uselessness. Drawing on Ed Zitron and Cory Doctorow's critiques
of platform economics, Jürgen Schmidhuber's epistemology of compression, and
the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, we analyze how users
pay—through data, fees, or cognitive labor—to sustain systems that prioritize com-
putational throughput over semantic value. Historical analogies, empirical cases
(Gmail, GitHub, Reddit), and field-theoretic formalizations reveal a new political
economy where noise is commodified, and genuine compression is expropriated. We
propose a Deccelerationist ethics of entropy-respecting governance to restore value
to novelty and agency.

Introduction
The information economy of the twenty-first century has inverted the logic of knowledge
production. Where early modern scientific journals, subsidized by royal patronage, pro-

jected epistemic authority through print, today's AI platforms extract value by monetiz-
ing user-generated noise. This article synthesizes three intellectual threads: the political
economy of AI, as critiqued by ? and ?; the epistemology of compression, as formalized by
?; and a thermodynamic governance perspective rooted in the Relativistic Scalar-Vector
Plenum (RSVP) framework. Moving from historical analogy to infrastructural analysis,
entropic formalism, and normative reconstruction, we argue that the "vanity press econ-
omy" transforms the informational commons into a self-funding engine of uselessness,
necessitating policies that reward semantic novelty over redundant circulation.

Royal Vanity Presses and the Birth of Subsidized
Knowledge
In the seventeenth century, scientific journals like the Mémoires and Philosophical Trans-
actions served as state-sanctioned prestige machines. Subsidized by royal or institutional
patronage, these publications were less commercial ventures than demonstrations of epis-
temic control.
As ?
observes, they "could not have survived as for-profit ventures,"
relying instead on the court's largesse to project authority through print (?). The emer-
gence of peer review formalized this control, acting as a state-mediated filter that balanced
censorship with the curation of rationality. Print's materiality—its cost and scarcity—
signaled abundance and sovereignty, aligning knowledge production with political power.
2.1
Censorship, Prestige, and Subsidized Rationality
This system was dual-faced: censorship suppressed dissent, while patronage elevated ap-
proved voices. Biagioli's analysis reveals that early journals were less about disseminating
truth than constructing a legible epistemic order. The royal vanity press subsidized ratio-
nality itself, transforming ink and paper into symbols of state legitimacy. This historical
precedent sets the stage for understanding modern platforms, where computational sub-
sidies serve analogous ends.

Subsidy Becomes Surplus: The Algorithmic Inver-
sion
Today's AI platforms invert the seventeenth-century model. Instead of patrons subsi-
dizing knowledge, users and venture capital subsidize computational throughput. Plat-
forms like Google and GitHub operate as digital chokepoints, extracting rent through
what ? calls "platform feudalism." The sovereign is now data accumulation: every user
interaction—prompts, posts, or synthetic outputs—bolsters metrics of engagement, com-
pute consumption, and valuation. Unlike the royal court, which paid to project prestige,
platforms charge users (via data, fees, or labor) to sustain their infrastructural dominance.

This inversion marks a shift from a commons-oriented subsidy to a rentier economy,
where value accrues not from shared knowledge but from privatized circulation.

The Paper-Mill Logic of AI
Modern AI systems operate as planetary paper mills, producing tokens as units of com-
putational prestige. Floods of generative-AI spam—on platforms like arXiv, Amazon
Kindle, or fake scientific journals—mirror academic paper mills that inflate citation met-
rics with spurious content (?). Every low-grade output consumes compute cycles, fills
storage, and refines model compression, making noise a primary commodity. We term
this profit mechanism computational seigniorage: the value extracted from issuing new
tokens of meaning, regardless of their epistemic worth.
This logic ties directly to energy economics. Compute cycles, like early modern print-
ing presses, are energetically expensive, yet their cost is offset by user contributions.

A single AI-generated article may be useless, but it still travels through proprietary
pipelines, reinforcing platform control over storage and computation chokepoints.

The New Political Economy of Uselessness
The AI economy transforms uselessness into a productive asset.
With platforms like
ChatGPT processing billions of tokens daily, and data centers consuming megawatts of
energy, the scale of this enterprise is staggering (?). Useless content—redundant posts,
synthetic essays—fuels model updates and engagement metrics, converting user attention
into platform coherence:
Φuser →Smodel →Φ∗
platform.
Intuitively, this equation describes a process where human creativity (semantic den-
sity, Φ) is dissipated into noise (entropy, S), which platforms compress into proprietary
order. Platforms act as low-entropy attractors (∇·v < 0), absorbing high-entropy content
and emitting curated outputs, depleting user agency while enriching corporate control.
5.1
Entropy Farming as Business Model
This dynamic constitutes entropy farming: a business model that commodifies informa-
tional disorder. By monetizing user interactions as billable "usage," platforms incentivize
volume over value, ensuring a self-funding loop of noise production.

Entropic Interpretation and the RSVP Triad
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) models cognition and economy as fields
exchanging order and disorder under constraint. Semantic density (Φ), attention flow
(v), and entropy (S) evolve via:
∂Φ
∂t + ∇· (Φv) = −λΦSS,
4

∂v
∂t + (v · ∇)v = −∇Φ + ηvS∇S,
∂S
∂t = α∇2S + β(∇· v)2 −γΦ.
Intuitively, these equations mirror feedback, storage, and dissipation in social systems:
ideas spread, attention flows, and disorder accumulates. Under platform consolidation,
negative divergence (∇· v →−δ(x −xc)) concentrates agency in corporate attractors.
The Lagrangian density,
L = 1
2|∇Φ|2 + 1
2|v|2 −V (Φ, S) −κ(∇· v)S,
reveals coercive bias (κ > 0) favoring infrastructural bottlenecks. Deccelerationist
governance introduces corrective terms (µ(∇S)2 −ν|v|4) to restore plural agency.

The Return of the Subsidy:
Demonstrations in
Platform Ecology
Early platforms like Gmail (2004) advertised collective expansion, with storage counters
dramatizing shared growth. By 2020, fixed quotas (15 GB) and subscriptions signaled
scarcity (?). GitHub's SHA-1 hashing charges for reference, not resource, monetizing
redundancy. Reddit's 2023 API paywall further exemplifies this shift, restricting access
to data once freely shared. These cases mark the end of the digital commons, converting
abundance into metered stasis.
Quantitatively, Gmail's free storage per user dropped from dynamic growth to a fixed
cap, while subscription costs rose (e.g., $1.99/month for 100 GB via Google One). This
inversion reflects an entropic dam:
∇· v ≈0,
dS
dt > 0.
Compression, once a public good, becomes a rentier mechanism.

Compression and the Theft of Novelty
Jürgen Schmidhuber's theory of compression progress posits that discovery reduces de-
scription length: Beauty = Lold −Lnew (?). A new ontology or algorithm shrinks the
manifold of error, yet platforms treat it as mere tokens, absorbing its value without com-
pensation. This mirrors intellectual-property law, where patents and copyrights protect
expression length, not compression eﬀiciency (?). The token economy mistakes repeti-
tion for creativity because it meters flow, not form. In RSVP terms, this mis-signing
(λΦS < 0, κ > 0) dissipates user negentropy into corporate coherence.
Epilogue: Toward an Entropy-Respecting Aesthetics
Drawing on Norbert Wiener's view of communication as negentropy and Gregory Bate-
son's "difference that makes a difference," we situate compression progress in a cyber-
netic lineage (?; ?). A civilization oriented around elegance would reward creators of new
mappings—those who reduce redundancy for all—while penalizing synthetic inflation.
Deccelerationism advocates a policy triad:
1. Reward compression: Compensate novel ontologies and taxonomies.
2. Penalize inflation: Tax redundant outputs to deter noise.
3. Preserve reversibility: Ensure user agency through transparent, portable interfaces.
> The future of knowledge lies not in larger models but in shorter descriptions. To
pay for tokens without rewarding compression is to tax intelligence itself.

Would you like me to expand this into the
full 100-project catalog
(with each item given a short description, 3D model note, and project status tag like
Canonical
/
Likely Canonical
/
Speculative
)?
That would mirror your earlier CAD-oriented catalog structure.
Dijiste:
Yes, please proceed with expanding the list into the full 100-project catalog. For each item, include a concise description (1-2 sentences), a note on any associated 3D model (e.g., "CAD model available for visualization" or "No 3D model required"), and a project status tag as specified (*Canonical* for established core elements, *Likely Canonical* for those with strong alignment to the framework, or *Speculative* for exploratory concepts). This structure will provide a comprehensive and organized reference, facilitating further analysis and integration within the Flyxion ecosystem.
ChatGPT dijo:
Perfect ‚Äî I can generate that expanded
100-project catalog
for you in the requested structured format:
Format per entry
:
Name
‚Äî brief (1-2 sentence) description of concept and role within the RSVP ecosystem.
3D Model:
note (CAD model available / in development / not required).
Status:
Canonical
/
Likely Canonical
/
Speculative.
Before I proceed:
Would you like the 100 entries to be grouped under the same
A-J thematic sections
(e.g.,
Core Theoretical Frameworks
,
Simulation Models
,
Language & Computation
, etc.) for readability and continuity ‚Äî or should I list all 100 sequentially without headings?
Dijiste:
All 100 sequentially
ChatGPT dijo:
Excellent ‚Äî I'll prepare the
full sequential 100-project catalog
accordingly.
Each entry will include:
Project Name
Concise Description
(1-2 sentences)
3D Model Note
Status Tag
(
Canonical
,
Likely Canonical
,
Speculative
)
Before I generate it, please confirm
one detail
so I can format it optimally:
Would you like the catalog to be
Plaintext / Markdown list
(ideal for GitHub, LaTeX, or direct integration), or
LaTeX-ready table or enumerated environment
(for inclusion in your formal documents, e.g.,
\section*{RSVP Project Catalog}
with
\begin{enumerate}
)?
Once you confirm, I'll produce the complete 100-project version in that format.
Dijiste:
Plaintext

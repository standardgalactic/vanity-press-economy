Integrating Enactivism and the Free Energy Prin-
ciple with RSVP
The free energy Principle (FEP) posits that cognitive systems minimize variational free
energy to align internal generative models with sensory observations, reducing surprise
and enabling adaptive behavior (?). enactivism frames cognition as a dynamic, embod-
ied coupling between organism and environment, rejecting purely representational views
(??). The RSVP framework models collective information dynamics through semantic
density Φ(x, t), attention flow v(x, t), and entropy S(x, t). This section integrates these
frameworks, aligning FEP's predictive mechanisms with enactivism's sensorimotor loops
within RSVP's field equations, and explores implications for the vanity press economy.
1.1
Free Energy Principle: Mathematical Foundations
The FEP defines variational free energy F for an agent with internal model parameters
µ, sensory data s, and hidden environmental states ψ:
F = Eq(ψ)[−ln p(s, ψ | µ)] −Eq(ψ)[−ln q(ψ)],
where q(ψ) is an approximate posterior over hidden states, and p(s, ψ | µ) is the
1

generative model. Minimizing F approximates Bayesian inference:
F = KL[q(ψ) ∥p(ψ | s, µ)] −ln p(s | µ),
where KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and −ln p(s | µ) is the surprise. Agents
minimize F by updating µ (perception) or acting to change s (active inference).
1.2
Enactivism: Embodied Coupling
enactivism posits that cognition emerges from sensorimotor interactions, co-defining or-
ganism and environment (?). Abstract thinking, per Gallagher, is a skilled practice using
cognitive affordances (e.g., diagrams) grounded in bodily action (?). This aligns with
FEP's active inference, where actions sample sensory data to reduce prediction errors,
but enactivism emphasizes non-representational, dynamic coupling over internal models.
1.3
RSVP Framework Recap
RSVP models collective cognition via:
∂Φ
∂t + ∇· (Φv) = −λΦSS,
∂v
∂t + (v · ∇)v = −∇Φ + ηvS∇S −ν|v|2v,
∂S
∂t = α∇2S + β(∇· v)2 −γΦ + µ(∇S)2,
where Φ is semantic density (meaning potential), v is attention flow (sensorimotor en-
gagement), and S is entropy (information disorder). Decelerationism introduces damping
(µ, ν) to stabilize dynamics.
1.4
Integration Framework
To integrate FEP and enactivism with RSVP, we map FEP's variational inference to
RSVP's fields and align enactivism's sensorimotor coupling with RSVP's attention flows.

1.4.1
FEP in RSVP: Free Energy as Semantic Lagrangian
Define a local free energy density within RSVP, associating each spatial point x with a
generative model p(s(x, t) | ψ(x, t), µ(x, t)):
F(x, t) = Eq(ψ(x,t))[−ln p(s(x, t), ψ(x, t) | µ(x, t))] −Eq(ψ(x,t))[−ln q(ψ(x, t))].
Relate F to RSVP fields by defining Φ as the negative log-likelihood of the generative
model, reflecting semantic coherence:
Φ(x, t) = −ln p(s(x, t) | µ(x, t)).
The attention flow v drives active inference, adjusting sensory inputs s to minimize
F:
∂v
∂t + (v · ∇)v = −∇F + ηvS∇S −ν|v|2v.
Entropy S quantifies model uncertainty:
S(x, t) = −Eq(ψ)[ln q(ψ(x, t))],
linking to FEP's entropic term. The RSVP continuity equation becomes:
∂Φ
∂t + ∇· (Φv) = −λΦSS + D∇2Φ,
where D∇2Φ accounts for diffusive updates to the generative model, aligning with
FEP's perceptual optimization.
1.4.2
Enactivism in RSVP: Sensorimotor Flows
Enactivism's dynamic coupling maps to v, which represents sensorimotor interactions
navigating environmental affordances. The gradient −∇Φ (or −∇F) directs v toward
3

regions of high semantic potential, embodying enactivist action-perception loops. For
example, in collaborative coding, v synchronizes across agents, reducing joint F:
Fjoint =
∑
i
Fi +
∑
i,j
Jij(Φi −Φj)2,
where Jij couples agents' semantic fields, reflecting social enactivism (?).
Abstract thinking, as a skilled practice, is modeled as a hylomorphism on RSVP fields:
hyloF = cataF ◦anaF,
where cataF folds environmental data into Φ (embodied understanding), and anaF
unfolds Φ for exploration, aligning with FEP's generative model updates.
1.4.3
Unified Dynamics
The integrated system modifies RSVP equations to incorporate FEP's free energy mini-
mization and enactivism's embodied coupling:
∂Φ
∂t + ∇· (Φv) = −λΦSS + D∇2Φ,
∂v
∂t + (v · ∇)v = −∇F + ηvS∇S −ν|v|2v,
∂S
∂t = α∇2S + β(∇· v)2 −γΦ + µ(∇S)2,
F(x, t) = Φ(x, t) + S(x, t) + KL[q(ψ(x, t)) ∥p(ψ(x, t) | s(x, t))].
The Lagrangian becomes:
L = 1
2|∇Φ|2 + 1
2|v|2 + F −κ(∇· v)S + µ(∇S)2 −ν|v|4.
This unifies FEP's predictive dynamics, enactivism's sensorimotor coupling, and RSVP's
collective fields. The F term drives perception and action, v enacts embodied interac-
tions, and Φ and S balance meaning and uncertainty.

Stability and Convergence
Linearizing around a steady state (Φ0, v0, S0, F0):
ω(k) = i(αk2 −λΦS −Dk2) ±
√
−γ + ηvSk2 −∂ΦF,
stability requires αk2 + Dk2 ≥λΦS, ηvSk2 ≤γ + ∂ΦF. The damping terms (µ, ν)
ensure convergence, preventing runaway entropy from platform-driven acceleration.
1.6
Implications for the Vanity Press Economy
In the vanity press economy, platforms disrupt enactivist coupling by replacing affordance-
rich interactions with tokenized rewards, increasing S without reducing F. computational
seigniorage extracts value from user-generated data, inflating F via prediction errors:
S(t) =
∫
Ω
(
vmarket(τ) −cproduction(τ)
)
ρ(τ, t) dτ,
where ρ(τ, t) is skewed by platform algorithms. The Decelerationism Compression
Commons counters this by rewarding reductions in Kolmogorov complexity (∆K), align-
ing with FEP's goal of minimizing F:
Rcreator(t) = τcCtotal(t)
∆K
Kbaseline
,
ensuring creators are incentivized for novel, embodied contributions. Sousveillance,
inspired by Brin's transparent society (?), monitors platform algorithms to reduce KL-
divergence, restoring enactivist agency.

1.8
Conclusion
This integration casts FEP's free energy minimization as a driver of RSVP's semantic
and attention dynamics, with enactivism's embodied coupling shaping v. In the vanity
press economy, it counters computational seigniorage by aligning incentives with mean-
ingful, embodied interactions, formalized through ∆K and F. Future work could explore
ecological costs and compression aesthetics within this unified framework.

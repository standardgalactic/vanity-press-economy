Five Ideas That Will Change How You Think About Intelligence, Reality, and Progress

We navigate our complex world by relying on simplified mental models. To understand thermodynamics, we picture a messy room. To understand perception, we imagine our eyes as cameras. To understand success, we think of a ladder. These analogies are comfortable, intuitive, and often useful—but what if some of our most fundamental ideas are not just incomplete, but actively misleading?

This post explores five surprising takeaways from deep dives into science and philosophy that challenge what we think we know. Each one invites us to reconsider a core concept, revealing a more nuanced and fascinating picture of the world and our place in it.

1. Entropy Isn’t Disorder—It’s Possibility

The most popular analogy for entropy is that it’s a measure of “disorder.” A tidy room has low entropy; a messy one has high entropy. This is a powerful image, but it’s a misleading simplification.

Consider pouring cream into black coffee. The initial turbulent swirls look highly disordered, but this state is actually lower in entropy than the final, uniform mixture, which appears more ordered. In this case, our intuition about disorder is the inverse of the physical reality. Another example comes from the cosmos. A uniform gas cloud spread across interstellar space seems less ordered than a star. Yet, when that gas gravitationally clumps together to form a star, the entropy of the system increases. The seemingly more ordered state is the higher entropy one.

Why does this happen? Entropy is better understood not as disorder, but as a measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements a system can have. The uniform, mixed coffee has vastly more possible arrangements for its molecules than the separated swirls of cream and coffee. While molecular disorder and entropy can go together, "It's not a reliable guide."

This reframing matters because it changes our entire conception of the universe’s trajectory. The universe isn't just marching toward a simple, chaotic decay. Instead, its tendency to increase entropy is a tendency to explore possibilities. This is the engine of complexity, the process that allows for the formation of stars, the evolution of life, and the emergence of creativity. The universe doesn't just get messier; it opens up new options.

2. We Don't Passively Receive Reality, We Actively Enact It

Just as we must revise our model of the physical universe, we must also challenge our understanding of our own perception. The common-sense view is that our senses are like cameras or microphones, passively taking in information from an objective world “out there.” Our brain then processes this data to build an internal model of reality.

A powerful alternative is “enactivism.” Its core idea is that our perception of the world is not received but actively created through our dynamic interaction with our environment. We don’t just map the world; we bring it forth through our actions.

Color vision is a striking example. Birds do not just see more or better colors than humans; their color space is structured so differently that it is “unimaginable for us.” This highlights that perception is a species-specific, enacted process, not a universal apprehension of a single, true world. Each species co-creates a world that is meaningful and navigable for it.

As cognitive scientist Francisco Varela explained:

That knowledge is not as we used to believe just an an apprehension of the world out there where you just fall in and then you take it in and you make a model, right? You process the information that the environment gives you. in fact that being in a world is a long process of co-evolution or co-definition between outside and inside

This idea fundamentally changes our understanding of knowledge. A scientific "discovery," for instance, isn't just finding a pre-existing fact, but co-creating a stable way of interacting with the world that reliably reveals it. Knowing becomes less about having a correct “map” of reality and more about successfully navigating a world that we simultaneously shape and are shaped by.

3. AI's "Waste" Heat Is One of Its Most Valuable Products

The valid concerns about the high energy consumption of AI data centers are widespread. Yet, a thermodynamically literate perspective reveals a counter-intuitive truth: the “waste heat” from AI is not a bug, but a valuable feature waiting to be used. The right question is not “Does AI consume energy?” but “Compared to what?”

The critique of AI's heat is a masterclass in thermodynamic hypocrisy. Our world is filled with machines—furnaces, boilers, idling engines—whose sole purpose is to burn fuel for heat, performing zero calculations in the process. They simply shed entropy into the air.

By contrast, computational heat is a byproduct of valuable information processing. This heat can be repurposed. On Earth, GPU clusters can be integrated into building thermoregulation systems. In low-earth orbit, a GPU can substitute for a traditional heating system on a satellite, performing vital computations while also keeping the hardware within its operational temperature range.

To call AI uniquely wasteful is to isolate it from the broader economy of wasted heat and overlooked infrastructure costs that dwarf server farms in scale.

Seeing computation and environmental regulation as two sides of the same coin allows us to design more integrated and sustainable systems. The "waste" is only waste if we fail to see its place in a larger system.

4. True Intelligence Isn't Just Learning, It's Knowing When to Unlearn

The conventional view of expertise often equates to deep specialization and perfecting a “signature approach.” We celebrate the scientist who becomes the world’s leading expert on a single method.

But this can be a trap. In AI, this is known as “reward-hacking,” where a system becomes exceptionally good at getting a reward within a narrow context but loses the ability to adapt when the environment changes. It masters the game but not the world.

This same pattern appears in human careers. In scientific research, communities can form around specific methods, reinforcing loyalty to an approach even when better tools exist. This attachment to a familiar tool, rather than the scientific goal, can slow progress.

A higher form of intelligence is “intellectual mobility”—the ability to recognize that your trusted method is no longer the best tool for the job and having the courage to change course. It is the capacity to unlearn what made you successful in order to adapt to a new reality.

As scientist Milad Malekzadeh puts it:

I no longer see success in science as being specialized in only one thing. True success is being the scientist who can recognize when their signature approach is no longer the best tool for the job and having the insight, freedom, support and courage to change course.

True adaptability requires us to align our work with evidence and goals, rather than with our own identity as an expert in one thing.

5. Progress Can Emerge from Structured Harm

This final idea is an unsettling but historically observable pattern. While toxic and repressive systems often break or erase most people who endure them, they can also paradoxically generate innovators who transform their fields.

Consider these examples:

* Torey Hayden, working in neglected classrooms with traumatized students, transmuted the immense constraints of her environment into a “radical pedagogy” for teaching children others had deemed unreachable.
* Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, facing exclusion in a male-dominated academy, transformed her isolation into a revolution in astrophysics by discovering that stars are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.

These cases illustrate the “unsettling logic of pruning for messiahs,” where extreme pressure and constraint force rare individuals to develop breakthrough insights that might never have emerged in more comfortable settings.

Their examples reinforce the unsettling logic of pruning for messiahs: toxic environments may traumatize the many, but occasionally they generate figures whose innovations transform the conditions of thought itself.

This observation does not justify or excuse the harm. Rather, it reveals the paradox of the bridge: while it provides a path to progress, it is often guarded by a troll of institutional toxicity. The challenge has always been for innovators to find a way past the troll without being devoured, using the very constraints of the system as leverage against it.

Conclusion: Which Bridge Will You Cross Next?

From the nature of entropy to the creation of reality, our most comfortable mental models often obscure a more interesting and complex truth. The heat from computation isn't just waste, true intelligence requires unlearning, and even the most toxic environments can inadvertently forge progress.

The theme connecting these ideas is that our most settled assumptions are the ones most in need of questioning. They are the old, comfortable bridges of thought we cross every day. But as we've seen, these bridges can be misleading, incomplete, or even guarded by trolls.

So, what comfortable bridge in your own thinking has a troll lurking beneath it, and what new crossing might you build to reach a more interesting truth?
